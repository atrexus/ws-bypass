# ws-bypass
A simple application that disables Roblox's working set detections. A detailed writup explaining the functionality behind this code can be read [here](https://blog.nestra.tech/bypassing-hyperions-working-set-detections/). This was developed for educational purposes only.

### Usage
The usage for this program is actually very simple:
1. Open `ws-bypass.exe`.
2. Run the Roblox Player (join a game).
3. Done!

Once complete, you should be able to read and write process memory without triggering any detections.
